    <h2>Mission Statement:</h2>
    <h3 id="misson"> Our mission at Apart and Together is to provide
    as many people as possible information and resources
    that relate to COVID-19 because everyone needs these
    resources to stay healthy. </h3>

    <h2> Why Apart + Together?</h2>
    <h3>We chose the name 'Apart + Together' because we believed this was
        the best way to describe the current situation. Althoug we are
        quarantine, and apart from each other, we still want people to have
        a way to connect together. This website will help people stay educated
        on COVID-19, so that we can flatten that curve, and go back to being
        with each other again.</h3>
